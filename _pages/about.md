I am currently working as a Threat Intelligence Researcher at eSentire. While I have always had a dream of becoming a police officer, I have found that being a cyber cop is incredibly exciting. My main areas of interest lie in threat hunting, incident response, and a bit of reverse engineering. I especially love reversing stealers and RATs. I began my career in the field of information security as an Information Security Analyst Intern in 2019 and continued to gain valuable experience in the SOC until 2022. Additionally, I was involved in developing content for blue teamers on platforms such as TryHackMe and Security Blue Team, which led to the creation of my online handle, 'RussianPanda.'

I find great satisfaction in contributing to the infosec community and I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. In my spare time, I indulge in activities like reading books, watching horror movies, drawing, playing League of Legends, and going to the gym. 

I have established this blog to conduct research and analyze malware during my spare time. The opinions expressed within the content published here are solely my own.
